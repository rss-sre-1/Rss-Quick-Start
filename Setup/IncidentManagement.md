## Incident Managment

#### Summary
Incident management is the process used by DevOps and IT Operations teams to respond to an unplanned event or service interruption and restore the service to its operational state. Our incident management team is in charge of this process. We have created templates for incident reports and incident postmortem analyses, direct others on how to deal with incidents, and keep track of all problematic events and happenings. We are also in charge of the deployment of the rss-evaluation and rss-frontend services.
* Team Leader: Jonathan Schmitz
* Team Members: Justin Cabrera, Robert Moody, Jared Malkin

#### Steps
1. Incident Identification, Logging, and Categorization
    * Once identified, an incident is logged and then categorized.
2. Incident Notification and Escalation
    * All relevant people (customers, stakeholders, developers) should be notified
    * Depending on the category, an incident may need to be escalated to the proper people
3. Investigation and Diagnosis
    * Investigate the type, cause, and possible solutions for resolving the incident
    * Appropriate remediation steps should be taken (i.e. lessening the damage done)
4. Resolution and Recovery
    * Ensuring that incident is resolved
    * Restoring systems to full functioning
5. Incident Closure
    * Providing a report or retrospective to teams (Postmortem analysis)
